# X-Rays_detection
This repository implements a deep learning model for detecting fractures in X-ray images, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with TensorFlowâ€™s Model Optimization Toolkit to prune the model during training. This process helps reduce the model's size, making it more efficient without sacrificing performance.
